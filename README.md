#  Random Reply Discord Bot

This is a personal project for a discord bot that randomly replies/reacts to messages with reactions/replies stored in a database, which is easily editable within discord through slash-commands.

## !Note

this repository uses my own database CorrodeDB. A version which uses MySql can be found in the 'mysql' branch (that version is not guaranteed to be up to date).

## Project setup
After cloning repository run:
```sh
npm install
```
To run index.js:
```sh
node index.js
```
### Slash-commands setup

Setting up slash-commands works through running the "register-commands.js" file.
All necessary information about how to do this is in said file.
